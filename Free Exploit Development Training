Incredibly interesting and informative interview.

Some takeaways:

Stephen Sims is the author of Gray Hat Hacking

He is also the author of the SANS advanced exploit development for penetration testers course, which is really advanced stuff.

Stephen has also its own YouTube channel:
Off By One Security

Learn Metasploit because it’s a powerful pentesting framework

0-day:
Zero-day is a vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software

N-day:
N-day is a flaw that is already publicly known but may or may not have a security patch available

Fuzzing:
In programming and software development, fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.

CTF:
Capture The Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which “flags” are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites.

Ctftime - a platform where you can see all the CTF events that go around the world

Zerodium - a platform where you can make money from selling 0-days

Lear C, C++, Rust if you want to become a developer; for scripting purposes and automating tasks python is the way to go.

Also, have a look into assembly language for doing reverse engineering with Gidra for instance.

Opportunities in crypto are definitely worth checking, especially from a technical standpoint.

Other book recommendations:
- Hacking, the art of exploitation by Jon Erickson
- The Shellcoders handbook

Other recommended SANS courses:
Check the Offensive operations courses by Job Role web page (in the SANS website)

The most effective way to learn hacking is by learning it like you are playing a video game where you start from level one and then you continue to build up to level two, three, etc.

At last, it’s all about your motivation and the path you want to take that will make you successful in cybersecurity.
